                        build key aspects and eventually lead the team.  This team builds a technology which delivers easily
                        configurable forms allowing customers to create individualized documents for online data collection
                        or distribution of information.  The collected data can be feed into our system’s model which is then
                        used to initiate the background check or generate a PDF file.
